# KiwiClaims
KiwiClaims is a claims plugin for CraftBukkit 1060. I hope to turn this into a fully featured plugin that can compete with modern claims plugins.

### What's done:
 * Claims with trust functionality
 * Claim saving
 * Cancel basic events

### What's to be done:
 * Implement proper messages and formatting.
 * Implement more events.
 * Implement exclusion zones - admin claims whose sole functionality is to stop players from claiming in that area. This is to prevent having other dependencies, like WorldGuard for WorldGuard regions.
 * Make claims configurable as to what things are allowed (e.g. allow button presses from outsiders).

Thanks to https://chew.pw/ for hosting the correct Bukkit API in their Jenkins repository.
